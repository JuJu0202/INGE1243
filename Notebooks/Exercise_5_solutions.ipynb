On the way down, the potential energy would decrease again such that, at each point on the path, the ball would have the same kinetic energy as on the way up. Because there is friction, however, part of the total energy is dissipated. As a result, the ball has less kinetic energy at each point on the way down. This means it takes longer to go down than to go up."
