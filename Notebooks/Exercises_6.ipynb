    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the motion of objects, one can distinguish two categories: on the one hand, arbitrarily complex, irregular motions and on the other, motions where coordinates and dynamical variables come back to their starting values after same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In course 4, we encountered a first type of periodic motion, namely, the **uniform circular motion**. In course 8, we described another periodic motion : the **simple pendulum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise session, let us focus on another object where a **periodic** motion is at play : the **spring**. Here is a representation of such spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercises 6/spring.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "It is known, as an experimental fact that, if you pull on the spring from its \"rest length\" $L$, a distance $x$ (from $x=0$), there is a restoring force **proportional** to the displacement. For exemple, if you triple $x$, you triple the force etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "When $x$ is positive, the force points in the negative direction and when $x$ is negative, the force is in the positive direction. This can be **modeled** by the following equation :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(t)=-kx(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is called the **spring constant**. This law is refered to as **Hooke's law**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the physical dimension of this spring constant ? \n",
    "2. What is its unit ? \n",
    "3. Could you propose a simple experiment to **measure** this spring constant ? (hint : hang a mass on the spring attached vertically)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us go back to our original figure. Considerer that the mass $m$ attached to the spring is brought to an initial position $x_0$ and that we release it at time $t=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are possible drawings of the **position** of the mass with respect to **time** (the green, red and blue curves). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercises 6/spring_oscillation.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which curve do you think is the closest to reality ?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to go with the red curve, \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Can you draw **qualitativelly** with respect to **time** (on the same graph), the position of the mass (that you have already), the **velocity** of the mass, as well as its **acceleration** (reminder: these objects (position, velocity and acceleration) do not have the same physical dimensions so they cannot be **compared** with each other - their relative amplitudes have no meanings) ? \n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the maximal value of the acceleration ?\n",
    "\n",
    "You assumed that the motion is **periodic**. So, there exist a time $T_0$ (called the **natural** time period) after which the mass is back to its original situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using **dimensional analysis**, can you find a way to construct an object with the dimension of a **time** ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **counter-intuitive** observation is that this **period** (the time that it takes for this object to oscillate once, back and forth) is completely **independent** of how far I move it out (as long as Hooke's law is appropriate to model the situation !). Whether we start with $x_{0}$ or $3x_{0}$, we still get a time period that is $T_0$. This will be clear from the mathematical derivation but still take **some time** to appreciate how astonishing it can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we took some time to familiarise with the spring, let us write down the **equation** governing the motion of the mass (with the approriate **initial conditions**). Assume that all types of **friction** can be **neglected**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the situation depicted by the **first** figure, \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Using **vector analysis** can you write down this equation (+ initial conditions) ? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you can solve it explicitely, bravo ! Otherwise, maybe you have the **gut feeling** that the solution **qualitatively** looks like a function that you know of, namely, the **cosine** (if you wonder why, we do not considered the **sine**, ask me at the end of the session).\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the parameters to properly specify a **cosine** ? Its amplitude $A$, its angular frequency $\\omega$ (rad/s) (which is linked with the time period with $\\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{T}$ - with $T$, the time period of the cosine) and its initial phase angle $\\phi$. Up to now, $A$, $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ are not specified but thanks to our equation, maybe, they will get some values !\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to \"put\" this **cosine** :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t)=Acos(\\omega t+\\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "into the equation that you founded and see how it can satisfy it, as well as the **initial conditions**. (Start by trying to see if we can satisfy the initial conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is $A$ ? $\\phi$ ? $\\omega$ ? and the time period $T$ ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now use our discoveries and solve an exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Suppose we have a mass (m=0.1 kg) attached to a spring (whose spring constant k is 10 N/m). At $t=0$, the mass is located in $x=0$ and its velocity is -3 m/s. Can you find the position as a function of time ? \n",
    "\n",
    "From this problem, we found out that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t)=-A\\omega_{0} sin(\\omega_{0}t+\\frac{pi}{2})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "11. From this equation, what is the kinetic energy at $t=0$ ?  \n",
    "\n",
    "With all these informations, here are **qualitative** drawings of the **potential energy** as of function of the **position** $x$ (orange, red, blue and green curve).\n",

    "\n",
    "12. Which one do you think is the \"right\" one ?\n",
