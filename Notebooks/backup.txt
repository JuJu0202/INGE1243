# Course 1 - Motivations

Physics is an incredible driver of science and technological progress, leading to engineering breakthroughs. Many marvellous physics discoveries of the past century are present in the daily life of many and no doubt that contemporary findings will play a huge role in tomorrow’s reality. In addition, the time-lapse between the academic comprehension
of physical phenomenons and their translation into technologies shrinks continuously.
In such context, managing projects involving physics require more and more insights on what is ’under the hood’.
This is the key motivation supporting this course : to give Business engineers the ability to capture the relevant
parameters at play in physics-driven projects.
We plan to teach you the relevant skills to reach a sufficient working proficiency in environments where physics plays a role : 
- judge the actual potential of technologies
- estimate task development difficulties 
- criticise physical-based technologies with the appropriate language and scientific method.

In your business engineer career, you will deal with a huge variety of considerations (financial, psychological, legal, technical, etc.). The number of parameters in human projects is **massive** and justify the usage of **non-deterministic sciences** (e.g. economy). The role of business engineers is manifold. For example, they have to see the **big picture**: ignore no link in the value chain, identify weak links or the missing links etc.

Speaking of big picture, consider the historical evolution of photography and peculiarly "cameras". People want <b>nice pictures</b>. Every business trying to depart from this rule were failures. From a pure physics point of view, designing the highest lens quality is the ultimate goal. In business, it is not the only compass. </div> 

Your responsability is also to answer the fundamental questions : **could this work ?** Helping you to answer this question (considering the physics link in the chain) is our core motivation. As an introductory tool to answer this question, let me elaborate on the concept of **back of the envelope computations** based on **orders of magnitude** (a.k.a. power-of-10 estimation) as what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask - the exact answer is not accessible.

## From physics to business : back of the envelope computations

In the natural sciences, back-of-the-envelope calculations are often associated with physicist Enrico Fermi, who was well known for emphasizing ways that complex scientific equations could be approximated within an **order of magnitude** using simple calculations (wikipedia definition).

Here are 4 back of the envelope computations supporting: the 'space' economy, the semiconductor market, the 

### The piano tuners in chicago 

One of the classic Fermi estimation problem is to estimate the number of piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago. Such problem presents so many unknown and the exact number seems (and perhaps is) unknowable. But actually, there is a way to get closer to it. As one may find, there are $10^{6}$ people in chicago. Supposing it is a rather young city, one could consider that *one out of a hunderd* ($10^{-2}$) people owns a piano. This means that there are roughly $10^{4}$ pianos in chicago that need to be tuned at least once a year. With really few researches on the complexity of the task, any good manager could estimate that tuning $10^{2}$ per year is a good rate for a tuner. Our back of the envelope computation tells us that there is *room* for $10^{2}$ piano tuners ($10^{6}\times10^{-2}\times10^{-2}$) to make a living. The fun and baffling fact is that at the time Fermi asked for this question, there was 82 piano tuners in the city of Chicago . Take a moment to appreciate the dialectic and the result.  

Fermi firmly believed that over-estimates and under-estimates would compensate and bring us at maximum one order of magnitude (o.o.m.) away from the true answer. 

The valuable economic toughts in this is that, with such computations, you can estimate weither or not the sector would be competive. As you can see there are not much more market shares for piano tunersleft (unless you revolutionize the piano tuning techniques). Also, as a piano tuner manager, I should know that there is *room* for tens or more workers but surely not a hundred or a thousand.   

Eventually let's recall that informations about o.o.m. are fairly accessible nowadays thanks to the internet, search engines  and social networks. Together with probability and statistics, this methodology opens a door on many answers.

### Enabling space business

In the case of space flight, the critical breaktrought (considered by SpaceX - Elon Musk company) is a secured reusability of rockets (just as we have for aircrafts). If an aircraft was single-use, only few would fly. A Boeing 747 costs approximately \\$450 million for, on average, 450 seats. In order for flights to be economically viable, the engineers targeted (and guaranteed), **on the order of** 50.000 *flight hours* per aircraft (this corresponds to an average lifespan of 25 years). With such data, a flight costs a minimal price of $20 (per hour per passenger) - which becomes affordable. 

SpaceX thinks the same is true for rockets. A chemical propellant rocket (6 passengers) costs roughly \\$60 million and they stated that most parts of their latest rocket (Falcon 9) will withstand 100 launches. As you can compare the difficulty of reaching reusability is much greater for rockets than aircrafts (we will discuss why in chapter 6): earth gravity is hard to escape but it's even harder to reach earth surface from space with a vanished velocity). SpaceX continues its investments because it's only a matter of technical issues to bridge the gap between the 10.000 dollars ticket and "banality" of affordable space travels. If earth gravity had only been 10 percent stronger, such project would have been totally unrealistic.
