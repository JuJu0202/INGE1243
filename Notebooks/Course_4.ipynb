    "Now that we saw the importance of the carthesian coordinates system, let's have a look to another important one: the **polar coordinate system**. \n",

    "Taking back the painting of Kandinsky, from a specified origin, I would like to locate the center of one of the **blue circle** depicted on the painting. Suppose for a moment that you have the power to communicate with ants. Your best ant friend is located at the origin and you want to tell her how to reach point $P$.\n",

    "You already used your power to educate ants and so you know she has basic notions in geometry (lines, circles, etc.). You tell her to go a distance $u$ along a straight line (red) that you draw on the painting and then to follow the circle path (blue) and travel a distance $v$. $u$ and $v$ are expressed in meter because you assume she knows about the SI units. $u$ defines a **segment** and $v$ defines an **arclength**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Arriving at point $P$, the ant tells you that you have to be careful with the signs of $u$ and $v$. Indeed, she assumed that you gave her positive values and that you respected the convention regarding the angle (counterclockwise is positive and clockwise, negative). With two coordinates, there could have been 4 points that you were talking about $(u,v)$ (point $P$), $(-u,v)$ (green point), $(-u,-v)$ (orange points), $(u,-v)$ (purple point). She also let you know that she knows about **similitudes** and that the $v$ coordinate could be divided by $u$ - in order to be in correspondancy with the arclength on the **unit circle**. In such case, you could have specified as well an angle in **radian** ($\\theta=\\frac{v}{u}$). Also, since we are dealing with circles, $u$ could as well be noted $r$ (which she finds more suitable). \n",
    "\n",
    "With such coordinate system, you are now able to communicate **every** point, from the origin, uniquely with $r$ ranging from $0$ to $\\infty$ and $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$. Knowing that the original painting is $201\\times140 cmÂ²$, we can **measure** the coordinates of point $P$ with respect to the origin (with 2 digits, in cm and radian): \n",

The concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers, which is reflected in his famous quote: \"Give me a **lever** and a place to stand and I will move the Earth\".
