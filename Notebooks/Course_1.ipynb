    "# Course 1 - Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is an incredible driver of science and technological progress, leading to engineering breakthroughs. Many marvellous physics discoveries of the past century are present in the daily life of many and no doubt that contemporary findings will play a huge role in tomorrow’s reality. In addition, the time-lapse between the academic comprehension\n",
    "of physical phenomenons and their translation into technologies shrinks continuously.\n",
    "In such context, managing projects involving physics require more and more insights on what is ’under the hood’.\n",
    "This is the key motivation supporting this course : to give Business engineers the ability to capture the relevant\n",
    "parameters at play in physics-driven projects.\n",
    "We plan to teach you the relevant skills to reach a sufficient working proficiency in environments where physics plays a role : \n",
    "- judge the actual potential of technologies\n",
    "- estimate task development difficulties \n",
    "- criticise physical-based technologies with the appropriate language and scientific method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your business engineer career, you will deal with a huge variety of considerations (financial, psychological, legal, technical, etc.). The number of parameters in human projects is **massive** and justify the usage of **non-deterministic sciences** (e.g. economy). The role of business engineers is manifold. For example, they have to see the **big picture**: ignore no link in the value chain, identify weak links or the missing links etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Speaking of big picture, consider the historical evolution of photography and peculiarly \"cameras\". People want <b>nice pictures</b>. Every business trying to depart from this rule were failures. From a pure physics point of view, designing the highest lens quality is the ultimate goal. In business, it is not the only compass. </div> \n",
    "\n",
    "Your responsability is also to answer the fundamental questions : **could this work ?** Helping you to answer this question (considering the physics link in the chain) is our core motivation. As an introductory tool to answer this question, let me elaborate on the concept of **back of the envelope computations** based on **orders of magnitude** (a.k.a. power-of-10 estimation) as what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask - the exact answer is not accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From physics to business : back of the envelope computations\n",
    "\n",
    "In the natural sciences, back-of-the-envelope calculations are often associated with physicist Enrico Fermi, who was well known for emphasizing ways that complex scientific equations could be approximated within an **order of magnitude** using simple calculations (wikipedia definition).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are 2 back of the envelope computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The piano tuners in chicago \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the classic Fermi estimation problem is to estimate the number of piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago. Such problem presents so many unknown and the exact number seems (and perhaps is) unknowable. But actually, there is a way to get closer to it. As one may find, there are $10^{6}$ people in chicago. Supposing it is a rather young city, one could consider that *one out of a hunderd* ($10^{-2}$) people owns a piano. This means that there are roughly $10^{4}$ pianos in chicago that need to be tuned at least once a year. With really few researches on the complexity of the task, any good manager could estimate that tuning $10^{2}$ per year is a good rate for a tuner. Our back of the envelope computation tells us that there is *room* for $10^{2}$ piano tuners ($10^{6}\\times10^{-2}\\times10^{-2}$) to make a living. The fun and baffling fact is that at the time Fermi asked for this question, there was 82 piano tuners in the city of Chicago . Take a moment to appreciate the dialectic and the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fermi firmly believed that over-estimates and under-estimates would compensate and bring us at maximum one order of magnitude (o.o.m.) away from the true answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The valuable economic toughts in this is that, with such computations, you can estimate weither or not the sector would be competive. As you can see there are not much more market shares for piano tunersleft (unless you revolutionize the piano tuning techniques). Also, as a piano tuner manager, I should know that there is *room* for tens or more workers but surely not a hundred or a thousand.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually let's recall that informations about o.o.m. are fairly accessible nowadays thanks to the internet, search engines  and social networks. Together with probability and statistics, this methodology opens a door on many answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling space business\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of space flight, the critical breaktrought (considered by SpaceX - Elon Musk company) is a secured reusability of rockets (just as we have for aircrafts). If an aircraft was single-use, only few would fly. A Boeing 747 costs approximately \\\\$450 million for, on average, 450 seats. In order for flights to be economically viable, the engineers targeted (and guaranteed), **on the order of** 50.000 *flight hours* per aircraft (this corresponds to an average lifespan of 25 years). With such data, a flight costs a minimal price of $20 (per hour per passenger) - which becomes affordable. \n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceX thinks the same is true for rockets. A chemical propellant rocket (6 passengers) costs roughly \\\\$60 million and they stated that most parts of their latest rocket (Falcon 9) will withstand 100 launches. As you can compare the difficulty of reaching reusability is much greater for rockets than aircrafts (we will discuss why in chapter 6): earth gravity is hard to escape but it's even harder to reach earth surface from space with a vanished velocity). SpaceX continues its investments because it's only a matter of technical issues to bridge the gap between the 10.000 dollars ticket and \"banality\" of affordable space travels. If earth gravity had only been 10 percent stronger, such project would have been totally unrealistic.  "

    "# Physics : principles and laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Capturing how physics is at play and to domesticating the aforementioned motivations requires inevitably to grasp and understand the fundamental building blocks in physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The elementary block in physics is **observations**. Primarily with your **bare senses** and then with **scientific instruments**. Once a sufficient amount of observations of a phenomenon have been collected, we can try to propose a **representation**. The different types of representations are only limited by mankind imagination but a common way to represent a phenomenon in physics is with the help of mathematical tools (numbers, algebra, calculus etc.) in the so-called **laws of physics**. These laws are then used to realise **predictions** that can be used in other disciplines such as engineering, chemistry, etc. The **validity** (truth criterion) of a physical law (or physical theory) is tested thanks to **experiments**. As soon as an observation contradicts the theory, it is no more considered as valid. In this sense, everybody can experiment physics (in both meanings of \"to test\" and \"to challenge\") and is encouraged to do so !  \n",
    "\n",
    "The aforementioned picture of physics (which is not exhaustive of course) is lacking a fundamental element : **principles**. The question is the following. Let's consider that after some precise observations on (e.g.) **free fall** (an important motion in physics - see chapter 3), you happen to realise (so as Galileo in the 16th century) that the distance covered by the object is proportional to the **square** of the falling time. You also come to the conclusion, with appropriate experiments that this time is **independent** of the object mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "In the Western world prior to the 16th century, it was generally assumed that the speed of a falling body would be proportional to its weight—that is, a 10 kg object was expected to fall ten times faster than an otherwise identical 1 kg object through the same medium. </div> \n",
    "\n",
    "The computational framework is presented precisely in chapter 3 but the important questions to ask here are : why the **square** of time (and not the cube or even an irrational power) and why falling in a straight line ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Is there some sort of **principle** that objects **appearingly** respect to move the way they do ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into such deep questions, let's begin with easier considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dimensions, units and order of magnitude\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to start building a practical framework to **write down** physics. The starting point of such journey is the concept of **physical dimensions** of objects you can estimate with your bare senses: mass, length and time. Specifying that this dimensions are **physical** is important to avoid misconceptions mixing mathematical concepts developed also around the term \"dimension\". In some sense, it can be useful to make the distinction but from now, consider that word \"dimension\" stands for \"physical dimension\".   \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "The dimensions in this course are noted with <b>square bracket parentheses</b>. E.g. a object with dimension of mass is signified with [M], length with [L] and time with [T] </div> \n",
    "\n",
    "These dimensions distinguish physical objects from mathematical ones (pure numbers). When writing down physics, you come across **equations**. With a proper **dimensional analysis** you make sure that what you write has *at least* a physical sense. It is a very useful tool to check the correctness of formulas of various kinds and here is the principal piece of advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "Always check the dimensional consistency of equations by making sure that the physical dimension of whatever is on the left hand side of an equation appears exactly on the right hand side as well </div> \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you are covering a distance d (with dimension of length [$L$]) in a given time ([$T$]) and you are wondering how to relate your observations to your velocity. You may or not be moving at a constant speed but when you write down the equation expressing the velocity, whatever your write must *at least* have the dimension of length per time ([$LT^{-1}$]). It is call a **sanity check**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another example, according to Newton's second law of motion, \"force equals mass times acceleration\". Acceleration is the **rate** at which velocity changes, so it has the physical dimensions [$LT^{-2}$]. A force has thus the dimension of mass times length times the square inverse of a time [$MLT^{-2}$] **and so is true for every force, no matter its nature (gravitational, electrical, frictional, etc.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, you can now avoid a lot of mistakes. Consider the following. In an old book of physics, you happen to read that the gravitional force *equals* the product of the involved masses divided by the square of the distance between them\". Mentaly, you can check that it has dimension of mass square divided by length square ([$M^{2}L^{-2}$]) which does not have the dimension of a force ! You can directly tell that this book is probably missleading. \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of dimensional analysis is not only to check for consistency. It can also help you to realize **back of the envelope computations** and capture insights about technologies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, let's consider the valuable example of the **simple pendulum**. A simple pendulum is modeled as a rod of length $l$ [L] and a heavy bob of mass $m$ [M] and is free to oscillate about its point of suspension as presented on the following picture :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/simple_pendulum.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial angular amplitude is $\\theta_{0}$. This quantity is **adimensional** and is conventionaly expressed in **radians** in physics related problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "To measure an angle between two lines, you draw a circle centered at the intersection, no matter its radius (homothety). You measure the arc lenght defined by the lines (in blue on the following picture) and divide in by the radius of the circle (in red). The angle $\\theta$ has the dimension of [L/L] which is noted <b>[-]</b> \n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/angle.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum is supposed to be on **earth**. If we neglect friction (we do here), the oscillation continues forever. By conservation of energy, we take for a fact that the pendulum angular amplitude cannot get greater than the initial $\\theta_{0}$. The mass of the rod is also neglected, if not, this is no more a so-called **simple** pendulum. \n",
    "\n",
    "The question is the following: What is the **time period** (noted $t^{*}$) of the oscillation ? The time period [T] is the time needed for the bob to come back at its initial position. The complete approach would be to solve Newton's equation of motion, show that it is a periodic motion and compute $t^{*}$. At this stage of the course, we are not \"able\" to realize this yet, but we could get closer to the final answer with only **dimensional analysis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step could just be to list the quantity we think it could depend on. As a first guess, let's consider the following list: \n",
    "\n",
    "$m$,$l$,$g$ (known as the **standard gravity** at Earth's surface), $\\theta_{0}$ (a first guess would be that the larger it gets, the longer it takes for the pendulum to comes back at the original position), c (light velocity in vacuum), h (Planck's constant), G (the gravitational constant)(indeed, maybe not only the Earth's gravity is relevant, maybe the sun, jupiter or the moon are playing a gravitational role), $k_B$ (Boltzman's constant) etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's insist that it is a first **guess**. During the course, we managed to reduce this list with several physical arguments (e.g. Boltzman's constant $k_B$ is at play when temperature plays a role. It could indeed, due to thermal dilation, change the length of the rod and thus change a critical parameter of the problem. But it is **implicit** in such problem formulation that the temperature is fixed - otherwise, physical problem would take pages to be written down) to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m$,$l$,$g$,$\\theta_{0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "To **construct** an object that has the physical dimension of a time, we use the product of the listed quantities (with **integer** powers $a$,$b$ and $c$) *times* an **unknown** function $f$ of $\\theta_{0}$. **Only dimensionless quantities can appear in function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "A bogus argument is that real function can always be expended as a Taylor power series. For exemple, a function of the length $l$ would be non-sensical as we would add objects with the physical dimensions of length [$L^{1}$] to a surface [$L^{2}$] to a volume [$L^{3}$] etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(l)\\approx f(l_{0})+\\frac{f'(l_{0})}{1!}(l-l_{0})^{1}+\\frac{f''(l_{0})}{2!}(l-l_{0})^{2}+\\frac{f'''(l_{0})}{3!}(l-l_{0})^{3}+ ...$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "The length could be at play in a function if another length ($l^{*}$) was *naturally* present in the problem so that we could *construct* a dimensionless quantity $\\frac{l}{l^{*}}$.\n",
    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "The time period can be written down:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t^{*}=m^{a}l^{b}g^{c}f(\\theta_{0})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which in terms of dimensions reads:\n",

    "recalling that $g$ has the dimension of an acceleration and the function $f(\\theta_{0})$ is adimensional. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **only** (*only* is not justified - refer to the fundamental theorem of dimensional analysis if needed) way of constructing a time is then with the following constraints:\n",

    "b+c = 0 \\\\\n",
    "-2c=1 \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider that a company plans on launching a simple pendulum to measure the absolute **time**. Using dimensional analysis, you can directly tell that this project will be a failure. Indeed, as you probably know, Earth is not a perfect sphere. For example, the radius at the pole is roughly 6350 km and at equator, 6372 km. With little research, you find out that Gravity depends on the **square**  the inverse distance between the **center of mass** of objects. Considering the rod length are equal (manufactured so) so as the initial angular amplitudes, the ratio between both time periods is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{t_{equator}}{t_{pole}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{g_{pole}}{g_{equator}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{R^{2}_{equator}}{R^{2}_{pole}}}=\\frac{R_{equator}}{R_{pole}}=1.003...[-]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this 3 after two 0s really a problem ? Yes ! Supposing the pendulum, with appropriately choosen physical parameters, gives you **one second** at the pole, it gives you 1.003... second at the equator. Which is a different of a bit more than **30 minutes after a week**: dramatic for many industries where time plays a central role (almost every company in fact). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we identifyied a convenient way to describe physical object -with respect to their dimensions - it is practical to use numbers to **compare** objects with the same dimension.  The numbers are expressed in a decimal basis and the **unit** for a given dimension is choosen **arbitrarily** and defined by a **standard** (or etalon) by the branch of physics called **metrology**. \n",
