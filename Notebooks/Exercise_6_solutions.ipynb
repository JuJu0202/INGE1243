    "\n",
    "1. $k=\\frac{|F|}{|x|}$, $[k]=[MT^{-2}]$\n",
    "2. k is expressed in Newton per meter (N/m).\n",
    "3. If you hang a mass $m$ on the spring, at **equilibrium** the restoring force $kx$ is equal to $mg$. Thus $k=\\frac{mg}{x}$, where $x$ is measured (... with a meter). You can even reproduce this experiment with many different masses to enhance your precision on the value of $k$. \n",
    "4. There are no single answer to this question. It can be either the blue or the green curve.\n",
    "    1. It can be the green curve if you assume that friction (with the floor and the air) is **not that big** and that the potential energy stored in the spring is not completelly dissipated into heat and partially converted in kinetic energy. With a non-zero velocity in $x=0$ the spring can extend, go back and forth etc. But eventually, since you assumed friction, the motion will stop (reach its equilibrium position ($x=0$)). It is called a **damped oscillation**.\n",
    "    2. If you assumed that friction is **huge**, the blue curve is the one. Indeed, the mass can never cross its equilibrium position with a non-zero velocity. The restoring force brings the mass back to its equilibrium position with no oscillation. The spring is said to be **critically damped**.\n",
    "    3. You neglected friction and you **feel** intuitively that it oscillates : All the energy you stored by pulling on the spring is **conserved** (oscillating between potential (initially given) and kinetic energy. In physics related situations, the damping is often not that big and for a reasonable amount of time, the oscillatory motion can be considered as a good **model**.\n",
    "5. <img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Exercises 6/oscillations.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "6. Initially, we have a **force** that has a magnitude $kx_{0}$ and this force is equal to the mass $m$ times the initial acceleration so : $$a_{0}=\\frac{kx_{0}}{m}$$ \n",
    "7. What are the object that could be at play ? The mass $m$ and the spring constant $k$. As for the pendulum, the initial position $x_0$ (the equivalent of $\\theta_{0}$) could be at play in an unknown function $f$ through the **adimensional** quantity $x_{0}/L$ (where $L$ is the rest length of the spring).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[T_{0}]=[m]^{a}[k]^{b}=[M]^{a}[MT^{-2}]^{b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The couple $(a,b)$ is given by $(\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{-1}{2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we have : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$T_{0}=f\\left(\\frac{x_{0}}{L}\\right)\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remark : if you only found the square root part, it is already really good !\n",

    "8. Here is a **free body diagram** (showing all the forces acting on the body):\n",

    "\n",
    "The blue arrow represent the force due to gravity $mg$. The green arrow represent the reaction of the floor (exactly equal to $mg$ but with a different point of application and oriented in the opposite direction). The red arrow is equal to $-kx(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the sum of the forces equal mass times acceleration and thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\frac{d^{2}x(t)}{dt^{2}}=-kx(t)$$\n",

    "with\n",

    "and\n",

    "$$\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}|_{t=0}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "9. With $$x(t=0)=x_{0}$$, we get $x_{0}=Acos(\\phi)$. And with $\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}|_{t=0}=0$, we have $sin(\\phi)=0$ which means that $\\phi=0$ and thus $A=x_{0}$. From putting $x(t)$ into the equation, we find $\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$ and $$T=2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$. The smaller the mass, the smaller the time. The bigger the spring constant, the smaller the time... It makes sense. Also, and more importantly, the function $f$ that you suspected in your **dimensional analysis** is constant and has the value $2\\pi$ ! It is **indeed** independant of the initial amplitude... OMG ! \n",
    "\n",
    "10. $$\\omega_{0}=10 \\;(rad/s)$$. At $t=0$ we have $x(t=0)=0=Acos(\\phi)$. Obviously, $A$ is not zero (otherwise, x(t)=0 at all time... nothing moves). So we have $cos(\\phi)=0$, which gives two possibilities $\\phi=\\pi/2$ or $3\\pi/2$. Let us use the equation for the velocity :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t)=-A\\omega_{0} sin(\\omega_{0}t+\\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At $t=0$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v(t=0)=-3=-A\\omega_{0}sin(\\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for this equation to be solve, $\\phi$ has to be equal to $\\pi /2$ (otherwise, the minus sign cannot be right). And thus, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A=0.3$$\n",

    "The time evolution of position is :\n",
