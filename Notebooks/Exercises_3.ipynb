Both pipelines were shutted down, but remained full of gas in order to maintain pressure. Between the end of september and mid-october, The NGO \"Environmental Defense Fund\" estimates that these leaks released 115,000 tons of methane into the atmosphere, the equivalent of nearly 10 Mt (million tons) of CO2, with the same impact on the climate as the annual emissions of 2 million gasoline cars.\n",

    "\n",
    "In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other (pay attention to the synchronization of the balls hitting the ground in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMF4CD7i3hg). This is the principle of compound motion established by Galileo in 1638, and used by him to prove the parabolic form of projectile motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The horizontal and vertical components of a projectile's velocity are independent of each other.\n",
    "A ballistic trajectory is a parabola with homogeneous acceleration, such as in a space ship with constant acceleration in absence of other forces. On Earth the acceleration changes magnitude with altitude and direction with latitude/longitude. This causes an elliptic trajectory, which is very close to a parabola on a small scale. In this article a homogeneous acceleration is assumed and we neglect air resistance on the projectile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acceleration\n",
    "Since there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to $|\\vec{v}_{0}|cos(\\theta_{0})$ (with $\\theta_{0}$, the initial launch angle). The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal in magnitude to **???(1)**. The components of the acceleration are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_{x}= \\textbf{???(2)}$$\n",
    "$$a_{y}=\\textbf{???(3)}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The horizontal component of the velocity of the object **((6) change or does not change)** throughout the motion. The vertical component of the velocity changes linearly, because the acceleration due to gravity is constant. The accelerations in the x and y directions can be be used to solve for the components of velocity at any time $t$, as follows:\n",
