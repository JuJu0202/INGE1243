    "On a sphere, two antipodal points are diametrically opposite points on the surface of the Earth. Only **4%** of the Earth's surface presents antipodal points on emerged land. Since the Copernican revolution, these pairs of points have aroused many fantasies. You are about to teach yourself how to realize one of them...</div>\n",

    "### \"EarthY\" has big projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in 2050 and, an excentric billionaire named Leon Kums, and his freshly created company \"EarthY', plans to realize a crazy project : linking Europe to New-Zealand with a **tunnel**. He knows that, in Europe, the largest metropole for which this project is possible is **Madrid** (Spain). The GPS coordinates of the tunnel's entrance in Madrid are **40°25'0.1'' North, 3°42'12.9'' West**. This entrance can be connected to the Manawatu-Whanganui region.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are the coordinates of the second entrance of the tunnel ?\n",
    "\n",
    "This pharaonic project requires multidisciplinary skills and a good dose of audacity. This is why, as a BBeng graduate, you are involved in the project. Geothermal considerations aside, the core idea would be to use only the **gravitational force** to move the cabin in which the passengers would be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, would be to answer the following question : how long is the one-way trip ?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Journey/fig001.png\" width=\"700\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is not that simple. Still, you already know few interesting facts about this motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For example, the cabin acceleration on Earth's surface is :\n",
    "3. In addition, the cabin acceleration at the center of the Earth is :\n",
    "\n",
    "To go further, you formulate additional assumptions. Let us assume that the Earth has a uniform density and that the Earth is perfectly spherical. The tunnel is supposed to be vacuumed (with a pressurised cabin...). With a radius $R_T$ of 6371.008 km and a mass of $5.973\\times 10^{24}$ kg,\n",
    "\n",
    "4. the density of the Earth is found to be :\n",
    "\n",
    "The=is information is crutial for you to go further because, during a complementary research, you found out that : \"for a spherical object like the Earth, the **net** gravitational force acting on an object present in the inside of the Earth (e.g. the cabin) is **only** caused by the mass located inside the sphere of radius $r$ where $r$ correspond to the distance between the object and the center of the Earth\". Another way to state that fact is that the net force wherever you are, inside a spherical shell is **zero**. Such results is not trivial but does not hurt that much you common sense so you consider it to be true (the explaination can be found here for the curious : http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Mechanics/sphshell2.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. With this fact, and with the help of a free-body diagram, can you write down the equation governing the position of the center of mass of the cabin ?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For a cabin initially standing still at Earth's surface in Madrid, what are the initial conditions of the linear second order differential equation ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, you notice that this equation has the same **form** as a problem you already solved : the spring equation ! How funny !\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the same form, the solutions to both problems should look alike. You write down that :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r(t)=Acos(\\omega t+\\phi)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the units of A, $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ ?\n",
    "7. What are the expression of A, $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ ? \n",
    "8. Can you express the time period thanks to $\\omega$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. With all these informations, you can now estimate the duration of a one-way trip, which is :\n",
    "\n",
    "With a distance as the crow flies of 20.000 km between Madrid and the Manawatu region, \n",
    "\n",
    "10. What would be the average time for a commertial aircraft ? \n",
    "\n",
    "These numbers make Leon Kums really enthousiastic ! Nevertheless, you pinpoint a slight problem. Even with infinitesimal friction forces, \n",
    "\n",
    "11. What would be the passenger's terminus ?\n",
    "\n",
    "You remark bring an embarassing silence in the meeting room ... But your enthousiam is not altered. Indeed, that does not mean the project is over, that just means that a small amount of energy would have to be paid. \n",

    "The core is about 2,900 kilometers (1,802 miles) below Earth’s surface. The deepest humans have dug is a meager 12 kilometers (7.5 miles). Thus, we have no direct evidence about the composition of the inner core. Based on the prevalence of various chemical elements in the Solar System and the theory of planetary formation, however, researchers have come to widely believe the inner core consists of an iron–nickel alloy. And that it’s primarily solid. Given what we know about the properties of iron then, scientists have come to various estimates about the temperature of the center of the Earth. According to current research, the temperature of Earth’s inner core is approximately 5,700 K (that’s 5,430°C or 9,806°F). And believe it or not, this is about the same temperature as the surface of the Sun!</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "For many reasons, you find that the project seems unrealistic and you leave \"EarthY\" for better challenges. A year from your last meeting, you read in the press that : \" EarthY's scientists have developed brand new materials with a density 100 times higher than the most dense metals on the planet. The goal is to \"go faster by winning more velocity on the journey\". What do you think about the press release ? \n",
