    "# Let's sum up \n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now we can divide what has been seen through this course into **2 sections** : the **tools** and their **application on motions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"tools\" section\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool category has been constructed with the following methodology. First we studied **Kinematics** thanks to coordinates, (unit) vectors, scalar product, instanteneous velocity and instanteneous acceleration. Second we went further, thanks to **Newton's laws of motion**, by studying motions that were not **arbitrary** : we studied **Dynamics**. From instantaneous kinematics quantities (e.g. velocity) and **physical properties** (e.g. the mass) we defined quantities that were ruled by Newton's laws (e.g. the linear momentum $\\vec{p}=m\\vec{v}$ whose time derivative is equal to the **net force** acting on a body). Eventually, we showed that the dynamical quantities could help us to define different forms of **Energy** (e.g. Potential, Kinetic, etc.). We showed how to benefit from the **Work-energy theorem** to get insights on daily life situations (e.g. skiding distance on a bike). \n",
    "\n",
    "This methodology was elaborated, in 2D, from both the $(x,y)$ coordinates (helping to define **linear** quantities e.g **linear momentum**) and the $(r,\\theta)$ coordinates (helping to define **angular** quantities e.g. **angular momentum**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a table summing up the different tools that we now have at our disposal :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 8/tools.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"motion\" section\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we can list the different motiosn that we studied up to now : the \"free fall\", the \"projectile motion\", \"the inclined plane\" and go further with \"the simple pendulum\" and the \"spring\". \n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 8/motions.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### The work-energy theorem : the inclined plane - revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "As one can see from the table presented in the begining  of this course, the **angular** equivalent of $\\frac{mv^{2}}{2}$ is $\\frac{I\\omega^{2}}{2}$. Indeed, to change the angular velocity ($\\omega=\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$) of an object, **work** is required ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this analogy is left to you as an exercise. To help you, do not hesitate to consult chapter 10 of the reference book 'College Physics\" (peculiarly section 10.4 : Rotational Kinetic Energy: Work and Energy Revisited).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us apply the work energy theorem to the problem of the inclined plane: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta K.E.=Work$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This motion is really intersting as both the linear and angular velocity of the object change. Both inevitably change at a **rate** related to the mass $m$ and inertia $I$ of the rolling object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a figure of the situation. A frame of reference is depicted on the picture but we will write a **scalar equation** thanks to the Work-Energy theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/Cours 8/inclined.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From this picture, it is clear that the only force doing **work** (converting gravitational **potential** energy into **kinetic** energy) is the component $mgsin(\\phi)$ of the gravitational force. Let us consider the distance $d$ as the distance covered by the object. The **work** expresses then : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Work=mgsin(\\phi)\\times d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now figure out **how** the Kinetic energy changes assuming we start with $v_{0}=0$ and $\\omega_{0}=0$. We have :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta K.E.=\\frac{mv^{2}}{2}+\\frac{I\\omega^{2}}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v$ is the **linear** velocity after the object covered a distance $d$ and $\\omega$, its **angular** velocity after the same instant. The object has a mass $m$ and an inertia $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scalar** equation based on the work-energy theorem is : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{mv^{2}}{2}+\\frac{I\\omega^{2}}{2}=mgsin(\\phi)\\times d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, from course 5, we know that the inertia is expressed as : $bmR^{2}$ where $b$ is an adimensional constant and $R$ the radius of the object (in this course, we only consider the inertia of \"rolling\" object : disk, sphere, hoop etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the same course, we know that, to rotate without slipping, the **linear** velocity and the **angular** one have to be related to each other with the simple expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v=R\\omega$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now re-write the equation in the following way :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{mv^{2}}{2}+\\frac{bmR^{2}}{2}\\left(\\frac{v}{R}\\right)^{2}=mgsin(\\phi)\\times d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{1+b}{2}\\right)mv^{2}=mgsin(\\phi)d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is equivalent to :\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v^{2}(t)=\\left(\\frac{2gsin(\\phi)}{1+b}\\right)d(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the little trick : use the time derivative on both sides of this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(v^{2}(t)\\right)=\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\left(\\frac{2gsin(\\phi)}{1+b}\\right)d(t)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$2v(t)\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}=\\left(\\frac{2gsin(\\phi)}{1+b}\\right)\\frac{d\\;(d(t))}{dt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make **two** observations at this stage :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\frac{dv(t)}{dt}$ is the **linear** acceleration $a$\n",
    "2. \\frac{d\\;(d(t))}{dt} is the **linear** velocity $v$\n",
    "\n",
    "By dividing by $v$ both sides of the equation, we get : \n",
    "\n",
    "$$a=\\frac{gsin(\\phi)}{1+b}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is exactly the same result as the one presented in course 5 ! ($\\phi$ is considered positive in this case - it is just a convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "We got this result with a **single** scalar equation (how powerful !). \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach will be tested during the exercise session 6 on the **simple pendulum** (going from **dimensional analysis** to **vector equations** and eventually applying the **work energy theorem**). \n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining of this course is covered by Chapter 16 of the reference book \"College physics\". \n",
