    "The computation of ionization **energy** of the electron in a hydrogen atom was a result that paves the way to quantum mechanics. This **energy** (in Joules) is the energy required to separate the electron from the single proton constituting the hydrogen atom. In this exercise, both the electron and the proton are represented as tiny balls where the electron is orbiting around the proton on a **circular** trajectory (just as the Moon around the Earth). The equation of the uniform circular motion are considered to be valid. Such model is called the **Bohr model** of the hydrogen atom and, although it does not capture (at all...) the essence of quantum mechanics, it can (quite convincely) estimate some key features of this atom, such as the ionization energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only input of the exercise are to know that, the electron is orbiting a distance $R$ around the proton with $R=5.29*10^{-11}\\;m$ and that the electron has a charge of $-1.6*10^{-19}\\;C$ (the opposite of the charge of the proton).\n",

    "**One** joule, is the amount of potential energy that **one** coulomb has for a **one** volt difference of potential. Nevertheless, in **one** coulomb, there are plenty of electron charge ! One needs $\\frac{1}{1.6*10^{-19}}$ electrons to constitute one coulomb. At the atomic scale, it is more suitable to consider the potential energy a **single electron** has for a **one** volt difference of potential. This answer is called one **electron-volt** written $1\\;eV$ (simply a different unit system than the Joule that is more appropriate at the atomic scale)\n",
