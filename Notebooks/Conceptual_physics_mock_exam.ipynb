    "# Question 1 ( /7)\n",
    "\n",
    "This question evaluates your ability to **look** at the same problem with **different prospectives**. It will be sequenced in 4 parts : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimensional analysis** is used to identify the key feature(s) of the analysed motion.\n",
    "2. Based on a **free body diagram**, a **vector-based** equation is solved to complement the output(s) of the first question.\n",
    "3. The problem is now solved thanks to the **work-energy theorem**\n",
    "4. Your solution is tested to realize **predictions** on a real-life example with specified parameters that are, for example, a radius, a mass, a velocity etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "\n",
    "A familiar example is a playground swing, which acts as a pendulum. Pushing a person in a swing in time with the natural interval of the swing (its resonant frequency) makes the swing go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the swing at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the swing absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the swing's natural oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a walk in the winter 2023, you notice a child on a playground swing. It remembers you of your physics class where this peculiar motion was modeled by the theory of the **simple pendulum**. You sit on a nearby bench and, on a piece of paper, you depict the situation as follow :\n",

    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/mock_exam/simple_pendulum.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum has a length $L$, the attached bob is of mass $m$ and is subjected to the gravitational field at the surface of the Earth $\\vec{g}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see that one kid is not motivated and, does nothing on the swing. His father gives him an initial angle $\\theta_{0}$ and let him go with no initial velocity. Looking at the situation, you graphs two curves as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/mock_exam/swing_period.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Considering the situation, what is the dynamical quantity that the 'red' curve represents ?\n",
    "2. What is the dynamical quantity that the 'blue' curve represents ?\n",
    "3. Are these two curves mathematically linked ? \n",
    "4. If yes, by which mathematical operation ?\n",
    "\n",
    "After some time, you notice a significant decay. Pictured as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"../Figures/mock_exam/decay.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To what physical phenomenon is due this decay (the child does not move anymore after some time) ? Base your explaination on the work-energy theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, you notice that there seems to be a natural time interval in the swinging motion that you write down $T_{0}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Based on dimensional analysis, what can this $T_0$ depend on ? Can you give its expression ? Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "6. By what factor does $T_0$ change if the length of the pendulum gets multiplied by four ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Later that day, puzzled by your observations, you plan to solve the problem. At least, a simplified version of it, you neglect all sorts of friction. Also, polar coordinates appears as a natural choice for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Can you write down the equation as well as the initial conditions that models the situation (without friction !) ? Remember that the inertia of the simple pendulum is $I=mL^{2}$\n",
    "8. This equation seems a little tricky to solve. You remember that, for small angles, $sin(\\theta)\\approx \\theta$. With this approximation, you are able to solve this equation. Give your solution.\n",
    "9. What is the final expression of the time period $T_0$ ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next day, on the same walk, you reach again the playground. Nevertheless, this time, there is a child on a swing that seems to explain the other \"How to swing with no parents\". The other kids are listening carefully... so as you. \n",
